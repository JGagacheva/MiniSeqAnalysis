# MiniSeqAnalysis
The purpose oh this repository is to showcase my code for analysis of Next Generation Sequenincing (primarily Miniseq) data. The code is primarily written in R and Bash. The goal is to confirm the identity of a guide RNA in each sample. Addittionally, I calculate the percentage of that guide RNA in the sample, and the percentages of other potential guide RNAs in the same sample to determine if any cross-contamination has occured. This type of analysis is important when constructing pooled or arrayed libraries in high-throughput, where the identity and location of each guide RNA are vital for subsequent analysis.
